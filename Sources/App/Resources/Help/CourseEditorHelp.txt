# Course editor

## General

Here you can create a course.
The structure is as follows: there is a tree of course units-inside the individual course units there is a graph of new course units and so on.
For example: a bachelor's degree is a unit course. each semester is a unit course embedded in the bachelor's degree.
Moreover, the semesters form a graph in the form of a line. In turn, each semester has its own nested course units - tasks, lectures or something else.
Each unit has input and output skills - that is, what you need to know to start performing and what you will know after performing.

## Interface
On the left is the editing panel for the current course of the unit.
There you can change the name, see in which file it is saved. On the bottom left there is a library with skins.
To make the library work, connect some skill pack. To add a skill to a unit, select a skill in the library, click the add button and drag it either to the table or directly to the vertex.
To delete the desired skill, you need to first select it, and then drag the delete button. Well, or just select a skill in the table and click the delete button.

## Graph
You can drag the vertices with the left mouse button.
To add an edge, right-click on the vertex and drag the new edge to the vertex you need.
The freezing mode allows you to disable physics. To delete edges and vertices, turn on the delete mode and left-click on the objects that you want to delete.
